pyGP_PR is a library containing python code for Gaussian Process (GP) Regression and Classification.

pyGP_PR is a procedural implementation of Gaussian Processes.  
For a list of implemented covariance, mean, likelihood, and inference functions see list_of_functions.txt.

pyGP_PR follows the structure and (a subset of) functionalities of the gpml matlab implementaion by Carl Edward Rasmussen and Hannes Nickisch (Copyright (c) by Carl Edward Rasmussen and Hannes Nickisch, 2013-01-21). 

This is a stable release. If you observe problems or bugs, please let us know.
NOTE:   This implementation will be maintained as to bug fixes and corrections of problems in the execution of current functionality.  
Future extensions will be desigend for the pyGP_OO version only (https://github.com/marionmari/pyGP_OO) which is an object-oriented implementation of GP functionality.     

Further, it includes implementations of
* minimize.py implemented in python by Roland Memisevic 2008, following minimize.m (Copyright (c) Carl Edward Rasmussen (1999-2006))
* scg.py (Copyright (c) Ian T Nabney (1996-2001))
* brentmin.py (Copyright (c) Hannes Nickisch 2010-01-10)
* Mauna Loa CO2 data (Copyright (c) Pieter Tans, Aug 2012)
* FITC functionality (following matlab implementations under Copyright (c) by Ed Snelson, Carl Edward Rasmussen and Hannes Nickisch, 2011-11-02)
